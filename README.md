LegacyBar an ActionBar for Xamarin.Android (Mono for Android)
===================

> NOTE: This project was originally made, because there was no official Google backwards compatible ActionBar implementation. Since then one has appeared in the [Android Support V7 package](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/features.html#v7), which is now also [available for Xamarin.Android](http://components.xamarin.com/view/xamandroidsupportv7appcompat).
> Newest stuff is in the `eventmenu` branch.


This was originally a port of [android-actionbar by Johan Nilson](https://github.com/johannilsson/android-actionbar). 

LegacyBar is developed by [Tomasz Cielecki](https://github.com/Cheesebaron) ([@Cheesebaron](http://www.twitter.com/Cheesebaron)) and [James Montemagno](https://github.com/JamesMontemagno) ([@JamesMontemagno](http://www.twitter.com/jamesmontemagno)) and has moved away from the what the port initially was.

It now features:
* A fully customizeable Action Bar
* 4 Built in base themes
* Integrates with current Menus
* Overflow on API 11+ Devices
* Dynamic Action Bar Item Count based on screen resolution
* Importable library
* Bottom Action Bar (beta)
